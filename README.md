# PickPrice - Visual Product Pricing App

*Take a photo, get smart pricing for your resale items*

## What is PickPrice?

PickPrice helps you resell items by taking a simple photo and getting intelligent pricing recommendations. Perfect for clothes, electronics, collectibles, and more across platforms like eBay, Depop, Facebook Marketplace, and Mercari.

## How it works

1. **ðŸ“¸ Take a photo** of the item you want to sell
2. **ðŸ¤– AI identifies** the product using computer vision
3. **ðŸ’° Get pricing** based on current market data
4. **ðŸ“ˆ See trends** and optimal selling strategies

## Current Approach: Proof-of-Concept Scripts

We're starting simple! Instead of building a full web app, we're creating Python scripts to prove the concept works:

```bash
# Try it out:
uv run scripts/gemini_analyzer.py photo.jpg
```

**Available Scripts:**
1. `gemini_analyzer.py` - AI-powered product identification using Google Gemini API
2. `image_analyzer.py` - Identifies products from photos using Google Vision API  
3. `price_researcher.py` - Searches marketplaces for similar items and pricing
4. `ai_pricing_engine.py` - Advanced AI-powered pricing analysis
5. `ebay_api_researcher.py` - eBay marketplace research and pricing data

## Current Status

ðŸ”¬ **Proof-of-Concept Phase** - Building simple scripts to validate the idea

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pickprice-app
cd pickprice-app

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Set up your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Google Vision API key

# Try it out! (uv automatically manages the virtual environment)
uv run scripts/gemini_analyzer.py examples/shirt.jpg
uv run scripts/image_analyzer.py examples/shirt.jpg
```
